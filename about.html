<h2>Mission:</h2>
<p>The Open Source Seed Initiative (OSSI) is dedicated to maintaining fair and open access to plant genetic resources worldwide.</p>

<h2>Vision:</h2>
<p>The Open Source Seed Initiative (OSSI) seeks to enhance the broadest possible awareness and understanding of the critical issue of access to plant genetic resources. OSSI is engaged in education and outreach that promotes sharing rather than restricting access to germplasm, revitalizing public plant breeding, integrating the skills and capacities of farmers with those of plant scientists, recognizing the work of plant breeders of all kinds, and supporting a diversified and decentralized seed industry. A key tool for achieving these goals is development of a pledge to preserve the unencumbered exchange of plant germplasm for breeding purposes and the right of farmers to save and replant seed. OSSI is committed to building a branded, ethical framework that farmers, breeders, and communities may freely choose to employ in order to ensure the availability of their lines to this and future generations.</p>

<p>Today, only a handful of companies account for most of the world’s commercial breeding and seed sales. Increasingly, various forms of intellectual property rights are used to enhance the power and control of these companies over the seeds and the farmers that feed the world.</p>
<p>Protected seeds cannot be saved, replanted, or shared by farmers and gardeners. And because there is no research exemption for patented material, plant breeders at universities and small seed companies cannot use patented seed to create the new crop varieties that should be the foundation of a just and sustainable agriculture.</p>
<p>What is at stake is access to the plant genetic material that will be needed to breed crop varieties capable of feeding a growing population in an increasingly variable environment. We need to increase, not narrow, the availability of genetic resources and technical options. We need innovative plant breeding that produces resilient and productive cultivars adapted to thousands of specific places in a rapidly changing biosphere. We need to revitalize public plant breeding. We need to integrate the skills and capacities of farmers with those of plant scientists. We need to recover, reinforce, and expand an ethic of sharing rather than exclusion in germplasm exchange.</p>
<p>Inspired by the free and open source software movement that has provided alternatives to proprietary software, OSSI was created to free the seed - to make sure that the genes in at least some seed can never be locked away from use by intellectual property rights. Through our Pledge, OSSI asks breeders and stewards of crop varieties to pledge to make their seeds available without restrictions on use, and to ask recipients of those seeds to make the same commitment.</p>
<p>The OSSI Pledge: You have the freedom to use these OSSI-Pledged seeds in any way you choose. In return, you pledge not to restrict others’ use of these seeds or their derivatives by patents, licenses or other means, and to include this pledge with any transfer of these seeds or their derivatives.</p>

  Vision

  The Open Source Seed Initiative (OSSI) seeks to enhance the broadest possible awareness and understanding of the critical issue of access to plant genetic resources. OSSI is engaged in education and outreach that promotes sharing rather than restricting access to germplasm, revitalizing public plant breeding, integrating the skills and capacities of farmers with those of plant scientists, recognizing the work of plant breeders of all kinds, and supporting a diversified and decentralized seed industry. A key tool for achieving these goals is development of a pledge to preserve the unencumbered exchange of plant germplasm for breeding purposes and the right of farmers to save and replant seed.

  About OSSI

  The Open Source Seed Initiative (OSSI) was established in May, 2012, by a group of public plant breeders, private plant breeders, farmers, and advocates for a sustainable food system. OSSI was formed in order to enhance vigorous innovation in plant breeding by the creation of a framework for germplasm exchange that preserves the right to unencumbered use of shared seeds and their progeny in subsequent breeding programs.

  In recent years, the ethic of sharing seed among breeders has been rapidly eroded by the extension of various forms of intellectual property rights. Utility patents for plants have been especially problematic because patent claims usually prevent any use of protected material in research or for breeding new cultivars without the permission of the patent owner for twenty years. The ability to embed proprietary genes in cultivars has resulted in the proliferation of seeds that farmers cannot legally save for replanting and that breeders cannot use as parental material. Concentration in the seed industry has contributed to declining support for public plant breeding, a narrow corporate research focus on a limited number of crops and traits, and limited options for both public breeders and farmers.

  What is at stake is access to the plant genetic material that will be needed to breed crop varieties capable of feeding a growing population in an increasingly variable environment. We need to increase, not narrow, the availability of genetic resources and technical options. We need innovative plant breeding that produces resilient and productive cultivars adapted to thousands of specific places in a rapidly changing biosphere. We need to revitalize public plant breeding. We need to integrate the skills and capacities of farmers with those of plant scientists. We need to recover, reinforce, and expand an ethic of sharing rather than exclusion in germplasm exchange.

  To achieve these objectives, OSSI developing a tool that provides a framework for the unencumbered exchange of plant germplasm. Explicitly modeled on the example of “open source” software, OSSI has created a Pledge that farmers and breeders may freely choose to employ in order to ensure the availability of their lines to other breeders of this and future generations.

  The OSSI Pledge: You have the freedom to use these OSSI-Pledged seeds in any way you choose. In return, you pledge not to restrict others’ use of these seeds or their derivatives by patents, licenses or other means, and to include this pledge with any transfer of these seeds or their derivatives.
